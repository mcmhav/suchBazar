# In order to deal with partial orders, the Expected Discounted Rank Correla-
# tion (EDRC) introduced by Ackerman and Chen [1], combines AP correlation with
# nDCG to measure the similarity between two sets of pairwise preferences. Similar
# to both of them, EDRC emphasizes preserving the order of the userâ€™s most preferred
# items and applying a penalty for less preferred items. This metric tries to solve an
# important evaluation issue, that has been well introduced but not yet tested.
